# E-Commerce Data Analysis and Visualization

This project is for getting in-depth analysis on how certian KPI'S (key performance indictators) contribute to the growth of an online sales market. 
These KPI's include:
+ Purchase time
+ Average daily transactions
+ Gender type
+ Geographical purchase traffic
+ Status of transactions
+ Total revenue

This project for the public with much recommendations for people aiming to get into the field of data analysis, and also business managers that want to see how an interactive dashboard can give insights into the activities of their businesses.

## Data Source 

The data was sourced from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), an open source platform for getting open source public datasets.
The link to the dataset is: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/roopeshbharatwajkr/ecommerce-dataset
## Data Extraction
The dataset was gotten in spreadsheet(xlsx) format and imported into PowerBI. 

## Data Transformation
Before the dataset was loaded into PowerBI, it was first transformed.
+ The columns that were not needed for the analysis were removed [Transaction Id, Customer_ Id, Year_Month, Time].
+ The columns were converted to the right datatypes especiall the date column which was converted to the date datatype.
+ The value of Transaction_result was changed as 0 = Transaction failed and 1 = Transaction Successful.
+ The value of Transaction Start was changed to Transaction start.
+ The City['Los Angles'] was changed to City['Los Angeles'] for effective representation of the city on a map chart.
+ A date table was created using PowerBI date query code. 
You can find the code here: [PowerBI Date query code](https://github.com/Apprentice-doa/PowerBI-E-Commerce-Data-Analytics/blob/45be5e8cdba7cd96d9386aeb8132e80b1dcd63ea/PowerBI%20Date%20Query%20Code)
+ A new table was created by duplicating the main table and the Transaction result was filtered to have just Transaction Successful.
+ The transformed data was then apllied to the visualization panel.

## Data Modelling
New relationships were created between the tables, and date was used as the relationship between the three (3) tables.

## Data visualization
+ A measure table was created and total revenue, number of Successful transactions, number products sold, average daily transactions were all calculated using DAX.
+ Charts were used to check for:
+ Expected Revenue by Transaction result
+ Revenue by City
+ Revenue by Device Type
+ Revenue by Date
+ Revenue by Category
+ Revenue by Gender
+ Date and Customer Login type filters were created as well.

## Data Publishing
The data was published from the PowerBI environment and a linkn was generated for others to view and interact with the dashboard.
